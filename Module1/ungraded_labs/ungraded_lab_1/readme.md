# Python Refresher Lab
This lab provides a quick review of fundamental Python concepts commonly used in AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. It is intended for developers who need a brief update on Python syntax.

What's Covered
## 1. Lists
Basics: Creating, adding (.append), and removing (.remove) items.

List Comprehensions: A concise way to create lists using a single line of code instead of a for loop.

## 2. Dictionaries
Basics: Storing data in key:value pairs.

Iteration: Using the .items() method to loop through both keys and values simultaneously.

## 3. f-strings
Formatting: Using f"text {variable}" to embed expressions inside strings.

Prompt Augmentation: Practical examples of combining list data and dictionaries to generate formatted text blocks.

Key Takeaway
When using dictionary keys inside an f-string, ensure you alternate between single (') and double (") quotes to avoid syntax errors.
