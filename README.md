# Building RAG Systems: A Simple Guide
This project shows you how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. You will learn to give an AI its own "memory" so it can answer questions using your specific data.

🗺️ What you will learn
Turn Text into Math: Use "Embeddings" to help the computer understand the meaning of words.

Store and Search: Save your data in a Weaviate database to find answers fast.

Write Smart Instructions: Use "Prompt Engineering" to make the AI follow your rules.

Watch it Work: Use Phoenix to see exactly how the AI finds and uses information.

🛠️ The Main Tools
Python: The language used to write the code.

Llama-3: The "brain" (LLM) that writes the final answers.

Weaviate: The "filing cabinet" (Database) where information is stored.

Phoenix: The "X-ray" tool used to find and fix search errors.

🚀 How to Start
Open the Notebooks: Start with Module 2 and move through to Module 5.

Run the Code: Each lab is interactive—you can type your own questions and see the results.

Check the UI: Use the provided links in the labs to see visual maps of your data and traces of your AI's thoughts.
